# hack_assembler

Low-level machine programs are rarely written by humans. Typically, 
they are generated by compilers. Yet humans can inspect the translated code and learn important lessons about 
how to write their high-level programs better, in a way that avoids low-level pitfalls and exploits the underlying hardware better. 
One of the key players in this translation process is the assembler -- a
program designed to translate code written in a symbolic machine language into code written in binary machine language.
